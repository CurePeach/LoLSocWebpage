**New Legendary Skins: SoundCloud 9 (Minus 5)**

_To celebrate SoundCloud’s multi-year partnership with Riot Games to globally sponsor League of Legends esports_, _SoundCloud have helped develop four new legendary skins in collaboration with some of the premier creative forces in music._

**EkKodak Black**

_The Rift has a river wide and long enough for him to drive the boat (_[_https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej5av5R1RWA_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej5av5R1RWA "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej5av5R1RWA")_)._

_Eating Honeyfruit will come with a new sound effect (_[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVQV6UckNK0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVQV6UckNK0 "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVQV6UckNK0")).

**Ahri B**

_She’s conquered K-pop twice, but now it’s time for the Nine-Tailed Fox to claim her crown as the Queen of Rap._

_If Ahri B hits a champion with Charm, she can steal all of the Charmed champion’s Gold and they will blackout and wake up in a random location in the jungle._

**Juice WRWICK**

_Transformed by agonizing break-ups, Juice WRWICK’s body is fused with an intricate system of chambers and pumps, machinery filling his veins with Lean._

_After the suppression from Infinite Duress ends, Juice WRWICK will begin crying about losing another love._

**A$AP LeBlanc**

_Using the magic of recreational drugs, A$AP LeBlanc can appear to anyone, anywhere, and even be in many places at once._

_Careful with the Mirror Image, you’ll be reminded if you target the clone (_[_https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMHT8jejPnY_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMHT8jejPnY "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMHT8jejPnY")_)._

**Ryzeface**

_The Bluest of all Faces on the Rift, you better respect his Cryppin’._

_Those missed Overloads aren’t off-beat, they’re actually on-beat, so they’ll hit every time no matter where you throw them._
