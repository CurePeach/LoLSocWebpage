## \~Midsem Blues\~Â  Â :(

Hey everyone, welcome back to our second newsletter of the term!!Â ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰  
  
I hope you've all been hitting the books ðŸ“šðŸ“šðŸ“š, becauseÂ ðŸ˜¢ midsemsÂ ðŸ˜¢ are on the way! I believeÂ âœ¨âœ¨Â in everyone single one of you, so be sure to get HDsÂ ðŸŽ“Â and do me proudÂ ðŸ˜„!  
  
I, on the other hand, finished my midsems ðŸ”¥two weeks agoðŸ”¥ (not flexing ðŸ’ª, just giving context) and you already know I'm back on the SoloQ G R I N DÂ ðŸ˜Ž

It's been getting pretty ðŸŒ¨rainyðŸŒ¨ these days, so makeÂ sure to cover yourself up - healthy bodyÂ ðŸ’ª healthy mind! ðŸ¤”  
  
Happy April FoolsÂ btw, don't worry the emojis won't stay... I'm not that creative and I just wanted to just 'fool' around...

I hope no one felt board at our board and party games arvo! Plenty of you lovely people dropped in and out, and we were glad to see you come in to relax during your free time.  
  
We monoplayed many different games, from Connect 4 to Avalon, and Exploding Kittens to Smash Ultimate. Hopefully we didnâ€™t smash too many friendships!
