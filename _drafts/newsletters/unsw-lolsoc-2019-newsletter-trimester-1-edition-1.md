## \~Midsem Blues\~   :(

Hey everyone, welcome back to our second newsletter of the term!! 🎉🎉  
  
I hope you've all been hitting the books 📚📚📚, because 😢 midsems 😢 are on the way! I believe ✨✨ in everyone single one of you, so be sure to get HDs 🎓 and do me proud 😄!  
  
I, on the other hand, finished my midsems 🔥two weeks ago🔥 (not flexing 💪, just giving context) and you already know I'm back on the SoloQ G R I N D 😎

It's been getting pretty 🌨rainy🌨 these days, so make sure to cover yourself up - healthy body 💪 healthy mind! 🤔  
  
Happy April Fools btw, don't worry the emojis won't stay... I'm not that creative and I just wanted to just 'fool' around...

I hope no one felt board at our board and party games arvo! Plenty of you lovely people dropped in and out, and we were glad to see you come in to relax during your free time.  
  
We monoplayed many different games, from Connect 4 to Avalon, and Exploding Kittens to Smash Ultimate. Hopefully we didn’t smash too many friendships!

Wrapping Up

**Attention All Epic Gamers!**

I, **Big Boy Badam**, need your help to make LoLSoc great again! We need to create the biggest League of Legends society in existence, or our lives will be doomed. To do that, I need three things from you:

2\. Like our [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/UNSWLoLSociety/) page.  
3\. Join our [Discord](http://discord.gg/unswlolsoc).
