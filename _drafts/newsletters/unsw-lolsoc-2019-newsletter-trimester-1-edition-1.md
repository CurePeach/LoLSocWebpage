## \~Midsem Blues\~   :(

Hey everyone, welcome back to our second newsletter of the term!! 🎉🎉  
  
I hope you've all been hitting the books 📚📚📚, because 😢 midsems 😢 are on the way! I believe ✨✨ in everyone single one of you, so be sure to get HDs 🎓 and do me proud 😄!  
  
I, on the other hand, finished my midsems 🔥two weeks ago🔥 (not flexing 💪, just giving context) and you already know I'm back on the SoloQ G R I N D 😎

It's been getting pretty 🌨rainy🌨 these days, so make sure to cover yourself up - healthy body 💪 healthy mind! 🤔  
  
Happy April Fools btw, don't worry the emojis won't stay... I'm not that creative and I just wanted to just 'fool' around...
