### \~Trimester 1 Reaching a Close\~

Hey everyone, glad to you see all back! üéâ

How's everyone been? I had the pleasure of spending this weekend ploughing through two assignments while watching LEC Semis/Finals, LCK Finals, and LCS Finals in between.

Congrats to SKT T1 for regaining form and completely DEMOLISHING Griffin in a three-game smurf!! If only my ranked games were that easy... 

Kind of sad to see TSM suffer the reverse sweep in finals (espeically as a TSM fanboy), but I also personally think that they didn't deserve to win against C9... so I guess it's kind of poetic for them to get swept themselves. 

Oh and G2 just won finals 3-0 right then. Nice... anyone surprised?

MSI this year is looking THICC with super hype teams this year! I can imagine a world where a western team like G2 (sorry Liquid, maybe not you guys yet) cosplays 2018 Worlds and beats China and Korea. 

Anyway, that's all I have for intro today\~ Enjoy the rest of the read!
