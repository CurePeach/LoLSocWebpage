### \~Trimester 1 Reaching a Close\~

Hey everyone, glad to you see all back! üéâ

How's everyone been? I had the pleasure of spending this weekend ploughing through two assignments while watching LEC Semis/Finals, LCK Finals, and LCS Finals in between.

Congrats to SKT T1 for regaining form and completely DEMOLISHING Griffin in a three-game smurf!! If only my ranked games were that easy... 

Kind of sad to see TSM suffer the reverse sweep in finals (espeically as a TSM fanboy), but I also personally think that they didn't deserve to win against C9... so I guess it's kind of poetic for them to get swept themselves. 

Oh and G2 just won finals 3-0 right then. Nice... anyone surprised?

MSI this year is looking THICC with super hype teams this year! I can imagine a world where a western team like G2 (sorry Liquid, maybe not you guys yet) cosplays 2018 Worlds and beats China and Korea. 

Anyway, that's all I have for intro today\~ Enjoy the rest of the read!

### Lan Party!

Thanks to all those who came and LAN-ded a skillshot or two last Sunday! It was amazing seeing everyone having fun and supporting one another during the tournament. :D A big shout out to those who tried their best on the day in the tournament, sometimes it just ain't our day on the rift. Congratulations to the champions of their own champs:
