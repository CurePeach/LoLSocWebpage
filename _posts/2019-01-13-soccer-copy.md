## **2019 O-Week Volunteer Callout**  

Got free time during O-Week? (February 11 to 15) Want to become more involved in LoLSoc?  

LoLSoc is looking for volunteers to assist their stall during O-Week  2019! Come help introduce people to League, sign up new members, and  meet the execs!  

If you have any doubts, fear not! There will be a Training Day prior to  O-Week in order to teach you the necessary skills. These skills will  also help you for events in other societies and in general uni life.
